## Significance

Attaching the components with screws, nuts, and standoffs makes it much less likely for them to fall off or wires attached to detach. This happened a lot with my current protype
because none of the components were actually attached. I plan to use standoffs between the layers of the build also. Other than that, all of these have a great assortment of never-ending 
uses everywhere in the project.

### Why so much and many?

For just securing some parts 320pcs of such a great variety seems overkill and a waste of money, but actually, its not.

##### *Motor*

Several times, motors would just *fall off of the car mid-run*. this would end the run as a whole and sometimes damage the rest of the car.
I have tried **SO MANY** ways to keep the motors in one place but none of them are 100% perfect.
These are just a few (the entire long list and timeline of my attempts is in my devlogs):
  + Tape
  + Little Screw Nut
  + Cardboard Washer
  + Rubber Band
  + Plastic Wire
  + Copper Wire
  + Bigger Tape
  + Plastic band
  + Glue
  + More
Proof of all of these methods is in my devlogs and my pictures too. This is just a more condensed summary of all of what happened during
all of the devlogs sections regarding it. I know that screws, nuts and standoffs will really help *actually* secure the motor, because it is the most firm and best way.

##### *HC-SR04*

It's ground wire and itself are often dislodged. The ground wire significantly improved after the wire re-do but the HC-SR04 would often serve as a bumper to the car.
If it crashed the sensor would slam into the wall first. I am using double sided tape to keey it in place, but I still need to come over and tighten it every now and then.
I believe that just making the HC-SR04 more comfortable with these connectors would reduce its likelihood to both break physically and programattically.

##### Other components

The distance sensor and motors are just examples of components who would benefit, they two benefit the most, but certainly the other components could also really use this.
All of them have mounting holes.

This kit is a *crucial* part of the build.

## Software

Not Applicable, but treating the motors and the HC-SR04 better might improve thier performance.

## Wiring

Out of all of these kits I looked at this one had the best pairs and compatibility. There is so much variety and volume its almost impossible any components has something that does not fit.
For the motor securing in particular, I plan to put the screws all the way through then use washers and nuts too secure it. I already have some M2 screws and nuts and they were to small for the 
motor, so I knew that M3 was the way to go. Also, I need this because the M2 screws and nuts I do have I only have 4 or 5 of.

**In conclusion, this kit is vital for the connecting the entire build**
