## Significance

This is necessary so that my speech can be recorded and saved as audio so the AI can understand it. Without this, I couldn't communicate with it using my voice. Also, it is omni-directional for better recording quality.

## Software

There will be some sort of trigger or timer that governs when recording will start. Or maybe its always recording until a specific awakening call (Alexa uses 'hey alexa'). Once it is done recording this audio will be send to the AI.
I will use an LLM that accepts audio for this.
