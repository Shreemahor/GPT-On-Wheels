# Research

## Motors

I didn't know much about motors before and had minimal experience working with them (I only worked on one motor and one pump). I looked at what types of motors there are and browsed for some time. I also explored types of motors to determine which would be best for the car. I looked and watched some videos on mechanum wheels and considered servos. While it was interesting to learn this theory I just decided on 4 motors. Looking back, even though I did spend lots of time on finding parts and the driver I could have saved 2-3 hours if I just immediately picked that, even though other parts were interesting to learn about.

*Final configuration: 4 motors and l298n*

## General layout

I decided that the model would work like a layered cake. I am considering which screws and other peripherals are necessary to make this happen though. It also took me a long time to arrive at this layered setup. I looked at flat boxes, towers, and even hexapods, but the layers were easiest and most efficient

# Raspberry Pi Issue

I spent a ***VERY LONG TIME*** trying to connect my ribbon cable to my pi. This is the cable between a camera and the pi, but it was very hard to connect. I previously accidently bended and damaged it so that didn't help, and the python packages weren't installed properly. I finally solved this by using a flashlight and little screwdriver for adjustment and finally situating the cable. I had to do the camera installation process 3 times.  

## 10/9/2025 - CAD and Spreadsheet

# In FreeCAD

## Model

Just started a new model (pictured above). Its very simple now because it is in its initial phase.

## Spreadsheet

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTI3NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7d661704c7fccbe2dd8da90bf6d22e7641bdf17e/image.png)

I made a spreadsheet to organize my values so I would not have to end up redoing everything and figure out I had the wrong measurements, *like my last project*. To ensure that does not happen, I will continuously update it and refer to it.

#### Linking Error

For a long time I additionally tried to actively link my spreadsheet to the CAD Model, but FreeCAD wasn't allowing it. This process required links & alaisses and very complicated. I spent lots of time trying to get this done, but then I decided just manually referring to it was enough for now. This is were most of my time was drained.

# Research

## Standoffs

I also did some research. I finalized the mounting process. I would use standoffs and screws and found a nice set on Amazon.

## Speakers

I am going to look more into speakers. The model I liked was out of stock.
  

## 10/10/2025 - Got AI Model on Pi  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ0NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--572a18a36e87975a33fe7d07a33b3752f06be502/image.png)
***Gemma3:4b analyzed a picture taken by Arducam***
# First, research update

#### Microphone

I looked at a good microphone that's omnidirectional. 

#### Speaker 

I still did not find a good speaker (most of the speakers are very expensive and heavy).

#### Cables

I already have cables or wires, male to male, male to female, and female to female.

### CAD

Slowly making progress but not investing all my time into it.

# AI Model

## Plan

*Initial Plan*: to install a small model on the raspberry pi. This would be technically possible but I only had 3GBs left on the pi and so if I did I could barely use my pi anymore.

* Some Possible Solutions Explored* (I spent more time looking at more):
	1. just use a different free api key
		- did not do this because api keys have their limits and for privacy
	2. find the smallest model
		- if the model becomes too small like 990MB then there is no point in really using it due to its poor accuracy
		- pi could still slow down
	3. Use network to put model on the computer to the pi
		- this is what I chose
	
## Network

### Goal

Connect the model running on Ollama an app to control local ai models on my computer (gemma3:4b) to my pi through their shared network

##### First Problem: Server Listening

By default, ollama only listens to localhost (my own computer), in order to change this I needed to run a bunch of terminal commands some of them were:
	+ set OLLAMA_HOST to 0.0.0.0
	+ ollama serve
I also did other things in Task Manager like stopping the initial server

##### Second Problem: Firewall

My windows would block my pi from access through port 11434. I needed to set a new firewall rule using my pi's address so the pi can access it but my computer is still safe

##### Models

I checked some other models like *gemma3:1b* and *smollm* but these smaller models could not process images so after ***LOTS of research*** I finalized on *gemma3:4b*

## Final result

Camera activation:

I used rpicam (they changed libcamera to rpicam) to take a photo of a plush with my arducam. Then, I gave this to this model and asked it to "Describe this image and its theme in detail". It recognized the plush.

### Future

I might use I bigger model, and I have not linked the ai to motors.

One of many commands I ran to ensure it works:
the error is good as it confirms it is working

## 10/19/2025 - Working Car Prototype  

![IMG_20251019_195711770 (1).jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzY0MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6879c572cbf160f5c87e369ce2c0c49161a94f2f/IMG_20251019_195711770%20(1).jpg)
# Jump from planning

I needed all the planning, sample CAD, and research to get this far.
I also ended up using extra parts I did not plan for like tape and plastic bands.

# Components

### L298N Motor Driver

This was used to connect the motors to the pi. It has 4 outputs (it can control two motor pairs) and also has speed control

#### Powering Issue

For testing I used the pi's **5V** but that would not suffice in when the pi is independent of the cable, so I needed to use an external power source. I already knew this so had a *18650 battery*.

But the biggest problem was that 5V was not enough for 4 motors so I added two batteries but all 4 did not get enough power still. I spent a lot of time trying to fix a simple problem and even tried to get it to run on only 2 motors because getting all 4 was very hard. I tried:
	- Using a breadboard
	- using thinner wires
	- Swapping the motors
	- and more
Finally I realized that I had connected the wire of the batteries to the '5V' but that limits their voltage to only 5V so I needed to change it to 12V even though the batteries did not reach that much.
![IMG_20251013_213022055.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYwNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--72982ef0b8bead26e7e2fee88ab50d5b634e0a52/IMG_20251013_213022055.jpg)

### Pi

I used *GPIO 19 and 18* for PWM control and adjusting motor speed. I used other GPIOs for forward and backward control

### Power Bank

*5V 10A Miadi Power Bank* for powering the Pi. I got a warning saying that the pi did not get enough power so I needed to hit the power button anytime I wanted it to draw full power. I also went into config.txt in firmware and updated it with this exact line:
***usb_max_current_enable=1***

### 18650 Batteries

From Tokeygawa and have a case which had a on off switch which was useful when I forgot to connect PWM and had no jumper, resulting in the motors spinning forever. But, luckily I was able to just switch the batteries off before any serious damage.

### Motors & Tires

The tires had friction well and for the most part (except one that was slightly off) fit onto the motors and spun properly.

#### Connection Issue

The other issue that drained lots of time was that the wheels would not connect to my cardboard base.
I experimented with the following:
1. Normal Scotch Tape - this was very fragile and did not last at all
2. Screws
	- I used M2 Screws and Connectors but then this combo was too long and the cardboard and motor slots
	  did not have the required length, so I tried glueing on cardboard and even inserting cardboard to
	  to finish the fit
	- This worked but it was not as tight as I wanted it to be and was still a little wobbly so I 
	  searched for more solutions
3. Double Sided Tape
	- This worked surprisingly well although after some trial and error I found that the metal part of
	  the motor was most adhesive to the tape 
4. Wires
 	- putting a wire band through the two motor hole slots and tying it to the base
 	- heavier but stronger
 	- ran out of wire bands so I needed to use old male to male wires
5. Glue - worked very poorly

I finally decide on - 
***Double Sided Tape + Wires*** this combo worked best

## Body

I had two other initial bodies. One broke and the other was deteriorated from all of my connection method attempts. This is the initial old one:
![IMG_20251011_164423560.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYyOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fd1adeb7d8e64a79367cd3da8f0bcb38c6023fb8/IMG_20251011_164423560.jpg)

This is the final body, it has black tape so that the same error that the old body had does not also exist here. The black tape adds reinforcement. Finally I also later added a expo marker because I needed some blunt object to keep the cardboard sides from toppling.

## Final

I wired the components on the body.

# Future 

I must connect the ai model I have to this and plan for speakers and audio. I will also work more on the CAD.
