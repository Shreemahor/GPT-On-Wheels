## 10/8/2025 - Pi Issue and Researching Materials

# Research

## Motors

I didn't know much about motors before and had minimal experience working with them (I only worked on one motor and one pump). I looked at what types of motors there are and browsed for some time. I also explored types of motors to determine which would be best for the car. I looked and watched some videos on mechanum wheels and considered servos. While it was interesting to learn this theory I just decided on 4 motors. Looking back, even though I did spend lots of time on finding parts and the driver I could have saved 2-3 hours if I just immediately picked that, even though other parts were interesting to learn about.

*Final configuration: 4 motors and l298n*

## General layout

I decided that the model would work like a layered cake. I am considering which screws and other peripherals are necessary to make this happen though. It also took me a long time to arrive at this layered setup. I looked at flat boxes, towers, and even hexapods, but the layers were easiest and most efficient

# Raspberry Pi Issue

I spent a ***VERY LONG TIME*** trying to connect my ribbon cable to my pi. This is the cable between a camera and the pi, but it was very hard to connect. I previously accidently bended and damaged it so that didn't help, and the python packages weren't installed properly. I finally solved this by using a flashlight and little screwdriver for adjustment and finally situating the cable. I had to do the camera installation process 3 times.  

## 10/9/2025 - CAD and Spreadsheet  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTI3NSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--04948fa60bbb96739973966321c84fd80eff9092/image.png)

# In FreeCAD

## Model

Just started a new model (pictured above). Its very simple now because it is in its initial phase.

## Spreadsheet

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTI3NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--7d661704c7fccbe2dd8da90bf6d22e7641bdf17e/image.png)

I made a spreadsheet to organize my values so I would not have to end up redoing everything and figure out I had the wrong measurements, *like my last project*. To ensure that does not happen, I will continuously update it and refer to it.

#### Linking Error

For a long time I additionally tried to actively link my spreadsheet to the CAD Model, but FreeCAD wasn't allowing it. This process required links & alaisses and very complicated. I spent lots of time trying to get this done, but then I decided just manually referring to it was enough for now. This is were most of my time was drained.

# Research

## Standoffs

I also did some research. I finalized the mounting process. I would use standoffs and screws and found a nice set on Amazon.

## Speakers

I am going to look more into speakers. The model I liked was out of stock.
  

## 10/10/2025 - Got AI Model on Pi  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTQ0NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--572a18a36e87975a33fe7d07a33b3752f06be502/image.png)
***Gemma3:4b analyzed a picture taken by Arducam***
# First, research update

#### Microphone

I looked at a good microphone that's omnidirectional. 

#### Speaker 

I still did not find a good speaker (most of the speakers are very expensive and heavy).

#### Cables

I already have cables or wires, male to male, male to female, and female to female.

### CAD

Slowly making progress but not investing all my time into it.

# AI Model

## Plan

*Initial Plan*: to install a small model on the raspberry pi. This would be technically possible but I only had 3GBs left on the pi and so if I did I could barely use my pi anymore.

* Some Possible Solutions Explored* (I spent more time looking at more):
	1. just use a different free api key
		- did not do this because api keys have their limits and for privacy
	2. find the smallest model
		- if the model becomes too small like 990MB then there is no point in really using it due to its poor accuracy
		- pi could still slow down
	3. Use network to put model on the computer to the pi
		- this is what I chose
	
## Network

### Goal

Connect the model running on Ollama an app to control local ai models on my computer (gemma3:4b) to my pi through their shared network

##### First Problem: Server Listening

By default, ollama only listens to localhost (my own computer), in order to change this I needed to run a bunch of terminal commands some of them were:
	+ set OLLAMA_HOST to 0.0.0.0
	+ ollama serve
I also did other things in Task Manager like stopping the initial server

##### Second Problem: Firewall

My windows would block my pi from access through port 11434. I needed to set a new firewall rule using my pi's address so the pi can access it but my computer is still safe

##### Models

I checked some other models like *gemma3:1b* and *smollm* but these smaller models could not process images so after ***LOTS of research*** I finalized on *gemma3:4b*

## Final result

Camera activation:

I used rpicam (they changed libcamera to rpicam) to take a photo of a plush with my arducam. Then, I gave this to this model and asked it to "Describe this image and its theme in detail". It recognized the plush.

### Future

I might use I bigger model, and I have not linked the ai to motors.

One of many commands I ran to ensure it works:
the error is good as it confirms it is working

## 10/19/2025 - Working Car Prototype  

![IMG_20251019_195711770 (1).jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzY0MiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--6879c572cbf160f5c87e369ce2c0c49161a94f2f/IMG_20251019_195711770%20(1).jpg)
# Jump from planning

I needed all the planning, sample CAD, and research to get this far.
I also ended up using extra parts I did not plan for like tape and plastic bands.

# Components

### L298N Motor Driver

This was used to connect the motors to the pi. It has 4 outputs (it can control two motor pairs) and also has speed control

#### Powering Issue

For testing I used the pi's **5V** but that would not suffice in when the pi is independent of the cable, so I needed to use an external power source. I already knew this so had a *18650 battery*.

But the biggest problem was that 5V was not enough for 4 motors so I added two batteries but all 4 did not get enough power still. I spent a lot of time trying to fix a simple problem and even tried to get it to run on only 2 motors because getting all 4 was very hard. I tried:
	- Using a breadboard
	- using thinner wires
	- Swapping the motors
	- and more
Finally I realized that I had connected the wire of the batteries to the '5V' but that limits their voltage to only 5V so I needed to change it to 12V even though the batteries did not reach that much.
![IMG_20251013_213022055.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYwNSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--72982ef0b8bead26e7e2fee88ab50d5b634e0a52/IMG_20251013_213022055.jpg)

### Pi

I used *GPIO 19 and 18* for PWM control and adjusting motor speed. I used other GPIOs for forward and backward control

### Power Bank

*5V 10A Miadi Power Bank* for powering the Pi. I got a warning saying that the pi did not get enough power so I needed to hit the power button anytime I wanted it to draw full power. I also went into config.txt in firmware and updated it with this exact line:
***usb_max_current_enable=1***

### 18650 Batteries

From Tokeygawa and have a case which had a on off switch which was useful when I forgot to connect PWM and had no jumper, resulting in the motors spinning forever. But, luckily I was able to just switch the batteries off before any serious damage.

### Motors & Tires

The tires had friction well and for the most part (except one that was slightly off) fit onto the motors and spun properly.

#### Connection Issue

The other issue that drained lots of time was that the wheels would not connect to my cardboard base.
I experimented with the following:
1. Normal Scotch Tape - this was very fragile and did not last at all
2. Screws
	- I used M2 Screws and Connectors but then this combo was too long and the cardboard and motor slots
	  did not have the required length, so I tried glueing on cardboard and even inserting cardboard to
	  to finish the fit
	- This worked but it was not as tight as I wanted it to be and was still a little wobbly so I 
	  searched for more solutions
3. Double Sided Tape
	- This worked surprisingly well although after some trial and error I found that the metal part of
	  the motor was most adhesive to the tape 
4. Wires
 	- putting a wire band through the two motor hole slots and tying it to the base
 	- heavier but stronger
 	- ran out of wire bands so I needed to use old male to male wires
5. Glue - worked very poorly

I finally decide on - 
***Double Sided Tape + Wires*** this combo worked best

## Body

I had two other initial bodies. One broke and the other was deteriorated from all of my connection method attempts. This is the initial old one:
![IMG_20251011_164423560.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYyOSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--fd1adeb7d8e64a79367cd3da8f0bcb38c6023fb8/IMG_20251011_164423560.jpg)

This is the final body, it has black tape so that the same error that the old body had does not also exist here. The black tape adds reinforcement. Finally I also later added a expo marker because I needed some blunt object to keep the cardboard sides from toppling.
![IMG_20251018_164123293.jpg](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MzYzMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--33281746d57fa7b9feef49a00771a6e0d65bf925/IMG_20251018_164123293.jpg)

## Final

I wired the components on the body.

# Future 

I must connect the ai model I have to this and plan for speakers and audio. I will also work more on the CAD.

## 11/2/2025 - Code & Camera  

![IMG_20251026_215910434](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzg3OSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9bebca35fa6f81db306ea3c1f1debabca63a6288/IMG_20251026_215910434.jpg)
### Recap

Before what I had was a basic car, and this code was very simple and straightforward. Now I need to start using the camera and actually integrate the ai into it.

# Camera Mounting

Before, the camera was backward. This was one of the most annoying parts that was *very unnecessary* and made me almost want to quit the project in anger. *This camera would not stay in one place.*

## Tries

I needed the camera to not be backwards, so I tried many methods like:
	- cotton
	- cardboard stand
	- scotch tape
	- -string
But all of these failed and I just ended up wasting lots of time

#### Case

I don't have a 3d printer at home, unfortunately, so I need to use my school club's common 3d printer. Since there are 20 people using the same printer and the printer was blacklisted from the school wifi, it was very hard to get this printed, but I managed because my friend was kind enough to give his phone hotspot. But anyways, the problem with the case was that it was too tight for the camera, and even though it could work it could not fully fit in. If I had spent more time on this, I might have been able to force it to stay. Also, the screw holes were too small, but considering that it was my first cad, it was expected. After trying more combinations of the previous tries and the case, I decided it was best to just see if the ai could recognize what it was doing with a backward blurry image. 2.5 or 3 hours had passed from this alone, so I could not handle it anymore.

# Code

The code for this project is so extensive and explorable that it could be considering a software project too. I am going to put the full file in the repository but explain some components here. By the way, other than debugging a couple lines with syntax / simple name errors, I wrote all of the *153 lines of code by myself, without any AI* .This was the part of this log that took the most time, but unlike the camera, I regret nothing because I truly got lots of work done. Also, everything is in *Python*.

Used libraries:
	+ Langchain & related (ai framework, but due its enormous size, has dozens of individual libraries)
	+ mcp (core logic)
	+ Picamera2 (to control the camera)
	+ gpiozero (way to control hardware in pi 5)
	+ base64 (for image)
	+ dotenv (to load my .env, but you don't really need it)
	+ asnycio (ai takes time)

## Model

***This is the novel part of this project and what sets my car apart from every other car***.

### LLM

The core of the code, without it there is nothing to actually control the car. This is the *brain 🧠*
of the project.

openrouter_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free",

                   api_key=openrouter_api_key,

                   base_url="https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"

)

Langchain, an open framework for creating ai agents, is used in python for this example, and openrouter is used for this particular llm but I went between many and different providers.

### Image processing

with open(r"/home/shreemahor5/Python/Robot/Robot/image.png", 'rb') as image_file:

    image_bytes = image_file.read()

    base64_bytes = base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode("utf-8")

prompt = [

{"type": "text", "text": "Describe the image"},

{"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64_bytes}"}},

]

A series of transformations occur to the image file to make it suitable, then it is put in a suitable format for the llm, a list of dictionaries.

### Function & Connection

This is the most relevant snippet of the main ai call function:

async def agent(description):

    async with stdio_client(server_params) as (read, write):

        async with ClientSession(read, write) as session:

            await session.initialize()

            tools = await load_mcp_tools(session)

            agent = create_react_agent(llm, tools)

These must be async functions because the ai does not take a fixed amount of time to process anything - leaving the function to wait for its response, so asnyc functions are necessary. All the rest of the code does is just connect what I already have to my MCP using Langchain, and I will get to this.

## MCP

Now that the brain is done we need something for it to use, so we need *tools 🛠️*. In order to do this, I use something called ***MCP***, model context protocol, which is used to connect llms with tools, giving them the ability to reason and choose what to do, effectively making them agents. Without this nothing would be possible, its revolutionary.

### Sample tool

from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("Movement")

@mcp.tool()

def forward():

    print("\nForward\n")

    motor_a.forward(0.5)

    sleep(2)

    motor_a.stop()

There are more tools, but this is just one. In order to make a function an MCP tool, you must use the @mcp.tool() decorator on the function. It pairs very well with langchain.

### Motors

motor_a = Motor(forward=IN1, backward=IN2, enable=ENA, pwm=True)

motor_b = Motor(forward=IN3, backward=IN4, enable=ENB, pwm=True)

Motor a is the front wheel pair and motor b is the back wheel pair. This is how you control the motors, as defined in gpiozero docs.

## Main file

### Camera

cam.start()
sleep(2)
cam.capture_file("image.jpg")

This is just a small snippet, but it uses picamera2.

### Putting it all together

while True:
    if input("Do you want to run the test? (y/n): ").lower() != 'y':
        break
	answer = llm.invoke([HumanMessage(content=prompt)]).content
    print(answer)
    asyncio.run(agent(answer))

All this does is put together all the pieces of the code. The way it works is by having two llms, one interpreting the image, and one interpreting its interpretation, but I will go more in depth next log since this one is already too long.

# Result

I wrote some instructions on a paper, then made the ai interpet what to do, these are some.
![IMG_20251102_125657262](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzg3MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--58689cddf85e900f36940356c9842f73e9630b13/IMG_20251102_125657262.jpg)

Most of the time, it actually went forward or said that there was nothing to be done if there were no instructions, but it was a little confused as to when to go backward.

![IMG_20251026_215910434](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzg3NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--166e8c9ddd6cecd5dd84b55daf0d7992e65c02f2/IMG_20251026_215910434.jpg)

## Errors

Of course, my code did not work first try.

### MCP not connecting

I already expected this because I got the same error while I was experimenting with MCP a long time ago, I restarted the server, saved, stopped among other things because some combination worked last time. But, this time that was not enough, but it turned out that I had misspelt the name of the file. But it was good, I did the other checks on the server anyways.

### AI Hallucinations

Sometimes the ai would claim to be using an old mcp server, or just not see the tools. Sometimes, it just broke and took a long time. These are just some of its failures, but one that stood out and was the funniest error I have gotten so far in the project was this:
![mcp error](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Nzg3NiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--447c4274cb83a51a62f8e3e2e0fc7522cea4f941/mcp%20error.png)

## Additional Notes

The idea is uniquely mine, and I *did NOT use any youtube video for code or software guidance*. I used a thorough book and the online docs for some libraries, particularly, gpiozero docs was most helpful.

##### Car

Moves fine, but the front wheels bend inward, which is not nice. Also, more than once, mid-movement, the wheels have just come rolling of, so the car could still be improved. I am not working on cad but keeping it at the back of my mind.

## Future

I will explain more of the architecture and logical flow, since here I gave code snippets. Also, I will put the full code files in my repository. I am looking into putting a distance sensor to make sure the ai does not crash, the HC-SR04, which I already have.

## 11/5/2025 - Distance Sensor  

![WhatsApp Image 2025-11-05 at 21.58.01_6dbba28d](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODgxMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--3a5770a933ce2b8edfb8e209e2df5cfb27cdbc8f/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-11-05%20at%2021.58.01_6dbba28d.jpg)
*HC-SR04 Wiring*

# Recap

I previously got the camera and ai working.

## Problems along the way

#### Car Structure

The car's wheels sometimes lean to one side or the other, so I needed some way for the car's structure to be more safe. So, I put an expo market to sort of hold the cardboard pieces against each other and prevent them from bending inwards. I also used a glue stick in a similar way for underneath. I also added a second expo marker, but then once I found it ineffective, I just removed it.
![WhatsApp Image 2025-11-05 at 21.18.16_e0731f09](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODgwNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--be67518ad792392e0528c8b475b54668ee07de2a/WhatsApp%20Image%202025-11-05%20at%2021.18.16_e0731f09.jpg)
Before, I tried using the scotch tape and cardboard again, but it did go according to plan.

#### Fragile

Midway, sometimes the ground would just disconnect. Midway, the wheels would just come flying off.
There is really nothing I can do about this except upgrade to plastic case, but I don't have a 3d printer.

#### Camera

The camera, before, would not open. This was because I forgot to close the camera after opening it. I just forgot about his point on the last log.

# Distance Sensor

The distance sensor is necessary to make sure that the car does not crash. I am using the HC-SR04.

## Hardware

### Wiring Diagram

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODgwNywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--06cb98f2816b81c4718a4abfbefe48f954a11967/image.png)
Although, voltage will be supplied by the 18650 batteries.

### Math & Resistors

There are two resistors: a *470 ohms and a 330 ohms*.
They are used to form a voltage divider because the echo has *5V* but the pi's pins are *3V3*.
By connected 470 to ground, 330 to echo, and free ends to another pin, a voltage divider is formed to achieve this. The ideal ratio is *2:3* so any resistor combo that gets this is okay.

#### Other resistors

I did not have a 470 resistor so I put a 330 ohm and 220 ohm in series to form a 470. However, I just replaced it with a *510 ohm* later when trying to solve an error where the distance sensor picked up the same thing always

### Mounting

I realized that if I wanted to remain organized I needed a breadboard there, so I put everything on the breadboard and then put that on the car. The space was congested and it was hard to put wires in.

## Code

\# in main
ECHO_PIN = 6
TRIGGER_PIN = 13
sensor = DistanceSensor(echo=ECHO_PIN, trigger=TRIGGER_PIN, max_distance=4)

\# in file
from gpiozero import DistanceSensor
from time import sleep
from main import sensor

while True:
    print('Distance to nearest object is', round(sensor.distance * 100, 2), 'cm')
    sleep(2)

This initializes the distance sensor and prints how far away the object in front is in cm. The round converts it to cm and then rounds it to two decimal points. There is a 2 second delay between each reading.

### Same Value Error

No matter how far away the wall was, the sensor would always 1.25cm. There was also another variation of this same error sometimes where it would only print 100cm.

I spend a long time trying to fix this by restarting power, trying different GPIO pins and more. It turns out that I just needed to connect the entire system to my raspberry pi's ground. A seemingly complex problem actually had a very simple solution.

### No Echo Error

There was an error that said that no echo was received. This error just comes on and off around 20% of the time. I suspect this is because the HC-SR04 requires 5V and it sometimes does not get enough power because of the motors. I suspect this because this happens usually after a long motor run. The best solution I found to this was to just wait 30s and make sure the connections were secure, but if I had a better power source this might entirely disappear.

#### Wires

I initially used M to M, but then once I mounted the breadboard I used M to M connected with one F to F then another M to M. I realized this was redundant and was just better using a longer M to M and had to  spend more time replacing all the wires.

# Turning

The car could go back and forth but would not turn. This is because it was quite heavy and rectangular. Those two attributes mainly prevent the car from turning. I tried around 20 different approaches.

#### Long arc

It would go back very far, then slightly turn, then go forward and repeat this. This technically worked but it took around a minute and so much space it was not even worth it.

#### Back Forward

The front wheels would stay still and the back wheels would go full power, the intent of this was to sort of force the back of the car, and in turn, the entire car to turn, but since the weight was in the back of the car, this did not work, and the car almost moved as normal.

#### Opposite

Back would go backward, and front would go forward. This ended up producing a loud squeaky noise as the motors went against each other.

#### Front Forward

Back wheels would stay still, and front would go full power. This was the technique that showed the *most promise* since it was quick. Initially it got around 5 degrees, but it was something.

#### Other

- Other Speeds
- Pivot maneuver
- Hybrid of other methods

## Physics

### Front Forward

Front forward was the method that worked best, but it still needed lots of improvement, I was sure that with some modifications it would work.

### Physics Experiment

In order to understand how long to do front forward and how to improve it I needed to know its specifications. I conducted an experiment on it to see what it does. Materials I used were a ruler, protractor and tape. I put a piece of tape on the right front wheel to use as a reference point. Then I run front forward for 5 seconds. I then, using the protractor, measured the angle it had traveled. I also measured the distance the top of the car was from the tape to see how far it went forward, and I measured how far the right wheel was from the tape. I did this multiple times and recorded the results.

Results: it would got 5-10 degrees, it would move forward 12cm, and the right wheel was around 14.3cm away from it original spot.

Using these results I adjust the code to run longer, but this took way too long. I also had a look at the distance it would travel and tweaked it. This really helped me fix the issue but I also made some other adjustments.
1. Weight on the back
2. Left wheel loosened
3. Right wheel lubricated

#### Weight on the back

![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTYyMywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a6a0ff19d16602f552f186895cbff1d77184e872/image.png)
If there is more weight on the back it will turn better. This is because the lighter front will move with the force, but the heavier back will not move, but since they are connected, in the front's attempt to move it will pivot around the back.
Masses tried:
	- marker
	- eraser
	- stapler

I also tried with no masses. *Adding to much mass was NOT good* because nothing would happen then. I realized the the best setup was to lighten the front by removing one marker off it and putting a marker at the back.

#### Left wheel loosened

Usually a tire pushes down on the floor, and with the help of physics moves forward. Hower if I tilt that tire, then it will apply a force slightly to the left/right and that will help the tire pivot.

#### Right wheel lubricated

What tries to oppose this tilted tire is the other front tire because it still has a force that propels forward, at no angle. If this were to be also tilted, the entire front would lost structural balance and fall to the ground. Problem: need to negate the force causing forward motion without tilting the tire. Solution: Remove friction. All tires are made out of rough material and have grooves to catch friction. If you cover the grooves and make the material smooth, friction would significantly reduce. This is why I covered the right tire with scotch tape. I tried using scotch tape throughout this project, but this is the only time it actually helped.

## Turning

By taking advantage of physics I was able to make the large rectangular car with only four wheels turn.

# AI ON WHEELS!

The car could fully go and explore my house on its own with the AI.

### Pseudocode

if (distance to object is far):
	AI()
	go()
elif (distance to object is greater than turning distance):
	AI()
	turn()
else:
	## it's already too late
	backward()

The code follows this basic structure, combining everything discussed in my previous logs where I do detailed into the code.

##### Problems

- Sometimes the object would not be detected because the motors got the power and the distance sensor said "no echo"
- On each crash, the front wheels would take the damage, right front wheels was okay, but left front wheel was already tilted so it ended up falling the most.
- Ground would just disconnect because the car was going fast
- It would turn slightly more or less, especially after the front wheels were injured.
All of these were just random errors.

### Modes

There is discovery mode where the car and AI freely roam, logging what happens. I also had a mode where the car was controlled by the AI and the AI would determine what to do based on the camera.

I also spent a bunch of hours on the test runs and tested with even more objects like a glue bottle.
Also, the little plastic face was not something I 3d printed myself, but something that I salvaged from a previous project using that sensor.
For now, the basics are pretty much done. Next, I will do more research and planning and less hands-on work as a break.
