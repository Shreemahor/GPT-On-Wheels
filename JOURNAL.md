## 10/8/2025 - Pi Issue and Researching Materials

# Research

## Motors

I didn't know much about motors before and had minimal experience working with them (I only worked on one motor and one pump). I looked at what types of motors there are and browsed for some time. I also explored types of motors to determine which would be best for the car. I looked and watched some videos on mechanum wheels and considered servos. While it was interesting to learn this theory I just decided on 4 motors. Looking back, even though I did spend lots of time on finding parts and the driver I could have saved 2-3 hours if I just immediately picked that, even though other parts were interesting to learn about.

*Final configuration: 4 motors and l298n*

## General layout

I decided that the model would work like a layered cake. I am considering which screws and other peripherals are necessary to make this happen though. It also took me a long time to arrive at this layered setup. I looked at flat boxes, towers, and even hexapods, but the layers were easiest and most efficient

# Raspberry Pi Issue

I spent a ***VERY LONG TIME*** trying to connect my ribbon cable to my pi. This is the cable between a camera and the pi, but it was very hard to connect. I previously accidently bended and damaged it so that didn't help, and the python packages weren't installed properly. I finally solved this by using a flashlight and little screwdriver for adjustment and finally situating the cable. I had to do the camera installation process 3 times.  

## 10/9/2025 - CAD and Spreadsheet

# In FreeCAD

## Model

Just started a new model (pictured above). Its very simple now because it is in its initial phase.

## Spreadsheet

I made a spreadsheet to organize my values so I would not have to end up redoing everything and figure out I had the wrong measurements, *like my last project*. To ensure that does not happen, I will continuously update it and refer to it.

#### Linking Error

For a long time I additionally tried to actively link my spreadsheet to the CAD Model, but FreeCAD wasn't allowing it. This process required links & alaisses and very complicated. I spent lots of time trying to get this done, but then I decided just manually referring to it was enough for now. This is were most of my time was drained.

# Research

## Standoffs

I also did some research. I finalized the mounting process. I would use standoffs and screws and found a nice set on Amazon.

## Speakers

I am going to look more into speakers. The model I liked was out of stock.
  

## 10/10/2025 - Got AI Model on Pi

***Gemma3:4b analyzed a picture taken by Arducam***
# First, research update

#### Microphone

I looked at a good microphone that's omnidirectional. 

#### Speaker 

I still did not find a good speaker (most of the speakers are very expensive and heavy).

#### Cables

I already have cables or wires, male to male, male to female, and female to female.

### CAD

Slowly making progress but not investing all my time into it.

# AI Model

## Plan

*Initial Plan*: to install a small model on the raspberry pi. This would be technically possible but I only had 3GBs left on the pi and so if I did I could barely use my pi anymore.

* Some Possible Solutions Explored* (I spent more time looking at more):
	1. just use a different free api key
		- did not do this because api keys have their limits and for privacy
	2. find the smallest model
		- if the model becomes too small like 990MB then there is no point in really using it due to its poor accuracy
		- pi could still slow down
	3. Use network to put model on the computer to the pi
		- this is what I chose
	
## Network

### Goal

Connect the model running on Ollama an app to control local ai models on my computer (gemma3:4b) to my pi through their shared network

##### First Problem: Server Listening

By default, ollama only listens to localhost (my own computer), in order to change this I needed to run a bunch of terminal commands some of them were:
	+ set OLLAMA_HOST to 0.0.0.0
	+ ollama serve
I also did other things in Task Manager like stopping the initial server

##### Second Problem: Firewall

My windows would block my pi from access through port 11434. I needed to set a new firewall rule using my pi's address so the pi can access it but my computer is still safe

##### Models

I checked some other models like *gemma3:1b* and *smollm* but these smaller models could not process images so after ***LOTS of research*** I finalized on *gemma3:4b*

## Final result

Camera activation:

I used rpicam (they changed libcamera to rpicam) to take a photo of a plush with my arducam. Then, I gave this to this model and asked it to "Describe this image and its theme in detail". It recognized the plush.

### Future

I might use I bigger model, and I have not linked the ai to motors.

One of many commands I ran to ensure it works:
the error is good as it confirms it is working
