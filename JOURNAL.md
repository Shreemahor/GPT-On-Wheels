# Research

## Motors

I didn't know much about motors before and had minimal experience working with them (I only worked on one motor and one pump). I looked at what types of motors there are and browsed for some time. I also explored types of motors to determine which would be best for the car. I looked and watched some videos on mechanum wheels and considered servos. While it was interesting to learn this theory I just decided on 4 motors. Looking back, even though I did spend lots of time on finding parts and the driver I could have saved 2-3 hours if I just immediately picked that, even though other parts were interesting to learn about.

*Final configuration: 4 motors and l298n*

## General layout

I decided that the model would work like a layered cake. I am considering which screws and other peripherals are necessary to make this happen though. It also took me a long time to arrive at this layered setup. I looked at flat boxes, towers, and even hexapods, but the layers were easiest and most efficient

# Raspberry Pi Issue

I spent a ***VERY LONG TIME*** trying to connect my ribbon cable to my pi. This is the cable between a camera and the pi, but it was very hard to connect. I previously accidently bended and damaged it so that didn't help, and the python packages weren't installed properly. I finally solved this by using a flashlight and little screwdriver for adjustment and finally situating the cable. I had to do the camera installation process 3 times.
