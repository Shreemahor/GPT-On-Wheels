## Significance

Currently, the pi has a 15 cm ribbon cable, and this makes the camera **extremely annoying to control**. I have wasted hours on this one part of the project alone, and throghout my dev logs, from my first to my last, in multiple projects,
I have always talked about how problematic this wire has been.

### Biggest Issue

***THIS IS THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE FACED DURING THIS PROJECT, AND MAYBE EVEN IN ALL OF HARDWARE***

The wire just refuses to comply Now, it has been damaged so much, it has permanent bending and flattening. Over the past year, it just keeps getting worse.
*It might stop working and disable the camera completely*. If this happens then all of the other components will go to waste for this little mistake. This new ribbon cable 
will provide the project with a safeguard also. This will become the primary cable and the old one will become alternate just in case this one breaks. This new cable might solve
oe of **my biggest hardware issues ever**

Among bending and only going one way and twisting, the biggest problem is securing it to the fasteners on the camera and pi. This might have took 4 or 5 hours of this project alone and probably
much much more in all of the hardware projects I have built. If I get this new cable I will make sure that it works, treat in gently, and secure it patiently and in the best way possible.

## Software

If the cable is not properly attached, libcamera now called rpicam, the library that allows for camera checks (I will use rpicam for the rest of this project) will get an error if the 
cable is not properly attached. "No camera attached" along with ots of data and other warning in red will be displayed. This is how I know that the cable is misfunctionining. This happens always if something
is interfering with the cable. One time I put a peice of tape on the cable and it got that error. Whether or whether not the errors is how I will track the cable's stability.

Note: Just like the one in the diagram, the cable is white (as opposed to some of the coppoer ones)
